## About Wordbomb
- The Idea, the Vision: Hangman, but with a BOMB! We wanted to put a new spin on a fan-favorite game to dispel boredom and increase our vocabulary.
- Wordbomb pulls random 5-letter words from a random-word-generator API that the user must guess before they're out of lives.

## How to Play
- Guess letters that you think are part of the mystery word, but be careful! After 5 wrong guesses, it's game over and the bomb explodes X_X
- After every incorrect guess, the bomb fuse gets shorter and shorter. You'll get updates on how many lives you have left and all your incorrect guesses will be displayed onscreen in a wordbank.
- For every correct guess, the letter will be displayed in its correct spot in the mystery word.
